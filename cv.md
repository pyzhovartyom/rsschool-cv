## English level

I estimate my English level at **B1**. I've passed some free Internet tests which approved my expectations (also EPAM online test). During trips it was a pleasure speaking with citizens in English, but sometimes the lack of English speech practice made me feel discomfort and shyness.

So, I have a desire to speak fluently in English (and watch Engilsh movies) :)
